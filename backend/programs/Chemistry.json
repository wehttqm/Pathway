This is a one-term independent-study project course: students will be given a set of directed readings, then assisted in selecting an existing model from the literature. After reproducing existing results, students will be tasked with extending the model in a direction of their own choosing; this can include exploring different parameter regimes, incorporating new or different aspects of the underlying biology, or applying different analytical techniques. Students will work with the instructor to select a suitable project, matching their background and interests. Formal lectures will be replaced with a series of weekly meetings with the instructor to discuss progress and plans.", "prerequisites": {"and": [{"and": [], "or": ["JCP221H5", "PHY241H5"]}, "PHY245H5", {"and": [], "or": ["MAT212H5", "MAT223H5", "MAT232H5", "MAT242H5", "MAT244H5"]}], "or": []}}, {"name": "JCP421H5 \u2022 Quantum Mechanics II: Applications", "description": "The course offers an in-depth examination of the fundamental principles of quantum theory and a guide to its applications.
