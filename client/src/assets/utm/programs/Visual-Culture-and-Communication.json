Building on critiques of the category of \u201cnature\u201d as something that somehow pre-exists \u201cculture\u201d and is outside of it, which in turn challenges the terms of our distinctions between humans and animals, how does recent scholarship approach the place of images and vision in human-animal relations, and indeed the very idea of the animal itself?This seminar investigates these questions through texts that discuss key theoretical questions and examine representations of animals across a variety of media, species, historical or geographical contexts, and disciplinary approaches.", "prerequisites": "(VCC101H5 or FAH101H5) and  a minimum of 1.0 VCC credit."}, {"name": "VCC420H5 \u2022 The Visual Culture of Automobility", "description": "Cars are the quintessential mass-produced commodities, and as such are central to the spread of capitalism and to the forms, spaces, affects, and imaginaries of modernity, postmodernity and beyond.
